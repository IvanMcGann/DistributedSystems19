## Intro:
The purpose of this project is to gain practical experience in interprocess communication protocols used in modern distributed systems. You’ll build a distributed user account management system in two parts. Each part of the project will involve developing a service which will be able to connect to other services via APIs. Each service will be submitted separately. 

The two interconnected services you’ll develop are as follows:

• Part 1: gRPC Password service
• Part 2: RESTful User Account Service
